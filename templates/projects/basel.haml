  .description
    %p The project takes place on the peninsula of Rheinl√§ndede hafen. The site is characterized by the confluence of three countries: Switzerland, Germany and France and is a major issue for the close cities of Basel, Weil Am Rhein and Huningue. This harbor area is partially occupied by storage buildings and railways. It brings many interrogations about its urban renewal.
    %p The project has two different aspects, urban strategy with a compact and vertical layout, and the conception of a mixed used public building gathering a multimedia library, swimming pool and public forum.
    %p The main idea of this project is to split the different universes of the multimedia library and to associate them with the swimming pool and other equipments. For example, the childhood departement of the library is directly linked to the kids swimming playground. While being visually linked, the programs have to be compartmentalised because of the different atmospheres in each one, loud in the swimming pool and calm in the library.
